//! Rounds the corners of a webview.
//!
//! The modal is drawn by a webview of its own, and a webview is a rectangle. To
//! round it, the view itself has to be clipped, which every platform can do
//! through public interfaces:
//!
//! - macOS   the view is an `NSView`; its `CALayer` takes a corner radius.
//! - Windows the view is a window; a rounded region is set on it.
//! - Linux   WebKitGTK draws its own content and does not follow a clip set on
//!           the widget, so the corners stay square there.
//!
//! Clipped corners are simply not drawn, so whatever sits behind the modal
//! shows through them. No transparency and no private interface is involved.
